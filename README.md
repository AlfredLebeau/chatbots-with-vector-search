## Course Description

In this practical, scenario-driven course, AI expert Tobias Zwingmann shows you how to build an AI-powered customer support chatbot using n8n and a Large Language Model (LLM) of your choice. Step by step, design a bot that starts small—handling common FAQs with a well-crafted prompt—then level it up by connecting it to Pinecone, enabling deep searches across your documentation, policies, or product data. Learn the tools you need to know through the hands-on experience of solving a real problem. When you complete this course, you will have mastered the core concepts of building custom AI chatbots with n8n and gained insight into moving toward production-ready deployment. Whether you’re in ops, support, or product, this course gives you an edge in experimenting quickly with practical, high-impact AI workflows.
